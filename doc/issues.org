- [ ] IE can't guarantee that addEventListener will work, switch to
  using goog.event for a polyfill
- [ ] grabbing from the 'message' event needs to be validated
  better. Should cancel trying to grab the message if it can't be
  parsed.
- [ ] get flyer.min.js documentation, and get a working example
- [ ] create a good demo
- [ ] ensure that everything works down to IE9+
- [ ] window-list-key needs checks for when it's undefined
